Questions:
Skip Topic on every slide?
Home Button and other buttons where do they take you?

I know this stuff already!

Three Layers
User -> UI Layer -> Orchestration Layer -> Quantae Engine

Landing Page -> Sign In
	1. LoginUser
		a. CreateSession -> token
		
LogoutUser           
SkipSlide
GetNextSlide

NOTE:
We are introducing a concept of hubs which acts as a launching pad and allows
us to go to multiple different paths based on the user response.
This is a non-sentence interactive element with its own response types.
There are two types of hubs currently:

1. Lesson Hub, which acts as the landing page for the user and also shows up after every topic.
2. Extras Hub, which sits inside a topic and shows up when the user is done with Exercise and 
Review section, unless its a pseudo-topic.


Controller in MVC Parlance.
Service Endpoint
Orchestration Layer:
---------------------
(External facing interface)

CreateUser *Register
UpdateUser

LogIn(string username, string password) [Land on Lesson Hub]  -> CreateSession -> token in a cookie.
LogOut

StartSession -> Always return a slide.
RestartTopic -> resetting some counters and current state. -> returns a slide.
SkipTopic -> 

GetNextSlide(UserResponse) -> Slide [Of Different Types]
// SkipSlide -> return next Slide (Obsolete).

GetNextSlide and GetPrevSlide

every time a view model is generated it is pushed to the prev stack.
every time a user presses prev, a view model is popped from the prev
stack and pushed to the next stack.
every time the user presses next, we check if there is a view model
in the next stack and present it, otherwise go to the engine and 
generate it.
