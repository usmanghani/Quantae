two stacks,

next stack,
prev stack,

every time a view model is generated it is pushed to the prev stack.
every time a user presses prev, a view model is popped from the prev
stack and pushed to the next stack.
every time the user presses next, we check if there is a view model
in the next stack and present it, otherwise go to the engine and 
generate it.
